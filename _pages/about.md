## My Interests and Hobbies

I love watching TV Series and Movies in my part time. The favourite one is too tough to
decide as it keeps changing, though I love *Game of Thrones* and *Mr.Robot* the most. Recently, I have started following
*Westworld* and I love the way Jonathan Nolan has brought out the concepts of
Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction to reality. Other than these, I have watched *Black Mirror, Breaking Bad, House of Cards* and many more which I would love to talk about.

I read books in my free time. These are my all time favourites *Foundation Series, The last question, SuperIntelligence, A song of Ice and Fire*


I love following political debates and have my own views towards them.
